# The Data Analysis Process

**Defining an Objective**</br>
In data analytics, the first step is defining **Problem Statement**. This is the process of coming up with a hypothesis and figuring out how to test it. One can start by defining a business problem(eg. Why are we losing customers as Xiaomi). As a data analyst, you will look into depth by trying to find the factors that are negatively impacting the customer experience. The analysis is not limited to only this, of course there are other factors. Defining the objective is mostly about the soft skills, lateral thinking and the business model knowledge. Business Metrics and Key Performance Indicators(KPIs) can help track problem points.</br>

**Data Collection**</br>
Can be Qualitative on Quantitative Data. The data can be categorized into:

1. First-Party Data: This is the data thats is directly collected from customers through various channels such as website, mobile apps, social media accounts, customer relationship management (CRM) software. This data is clear and structured.

1. Second-Party Data: Second-party data is data that a company acquires directly from another company or organization, rather than collecting it themselves. A car manufacturer might acquire second-party data from a car dealership that has customer data from its own sales and service interactions.

1. Third-Party Data: Tt is data that is collected by one company and then sold or licensed to other companies for their own use. It can include demographic information, browsing behavior, purchase history, and more.

_Data Collection tool_</br>
There are various tools that can be used for data collection. One important tool that can be used for this is a Data Management Platform(DMP). It allows one to identify and aggragate data from numerous sources before you can manipulate it. Examples include Salesforce, SAS, Xplenty(Data Integration Platform). Some open source platforms can be Pymcore and Dswarm</br>

**Cleaning The Data**</br>
This is an important step in [EDA] Exploratory Data Analysis so as to get it ready for Analysis and make sure that you are working with high quality data. _Data cleaning_ is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset. Key cleaning data tasks include:

> - Removing major Error, duplicates and Outliers
> - Removing unwanted data points
> - Bringing Structure to the data eg. Fixing typos ot layout issues
> - Filling or removing unwanted

There are various tools that can be used for data cleaning. [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is one of the open source tools that one can use for data cleaning. This might not be suitable for large datasets. Python library [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and other [R](https://www.r-project.org/) libraries can be a much better suit for cleaning the large datasets. There are much more [DataCleaningTools](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-11-data-cleaning-tools-scientists-2022-harshit-goyal/?trk=pulse-article_more-articles_related-content-card) tools.

**Data Analyzation**</br>
Data analyis typically depends on your objective from the data. Some techniques of Data analysis include; Univariate or Bivariate analysis, Data Mining analysis, Time series analysi and Machine Learning. Categorically, all data analyzation can fit into:

> - Descriptive Analysis which uses current and historical data to identify relationships and trends
> - Diagnostic Analysis is an advanced analytics that examines data and diagnosing problems or issues to understand why it happened
> - Predictive Analysis is the analytics that makes predictions about future outcomes using statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze historical data
> - Prescriptive Analysis is the analysis where one analyzes data and content to recommend the optimal course of action to achieve the objective

**Visualization of The Data**
This invloves the interpratation of the outcomes and present them. The results are expected to be unambiguous. Data visualization is the practice of presenting information or data in a visual form, such as charts, graphs, maps, and other interactive visual representations. There are many tools that can used for data visualization. They include; Datawrapper, Tableau, Google Charts, Power BI, etc. These don't require one to have coding skills. Plotty, Seaborn and Matplotlab are some python data visualization tools.
